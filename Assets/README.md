🎮 Unity 2D Shooter Game

Built as part of the Game Design and Development 1: 2D Shooter course on Coursera
https://www.coursera.org/learn/game-design-and-development-1?specialization=game-design-and-development

📘 Overview

This project is a 2D top-down shooter game developed in Unity as the main practical assignment for the Coursera course
published by Michigan State University.

The goal of the project was to learn and apply the fundamentals of:

- Game objects and prefabs
- Player movement & shooting mechanics
- Collision detection
- Health systems
- Basic UI (score, health, game over)

This repository contains the complete Unity project demonstrating my implementation of the core mechanics taught in the
course — plus several personal improvements.
